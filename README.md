An attempt at making AIAG MSA ANOVA based Gage R&R in julia

# Usage
Screem at your PC incoherently for a bit

The idea is that this will have the ability to run Gage R&R on a dataset and create a report suitable for validating a measurment system. I only have a second edition copy of MSA by AIGA so some things may not be up to date.
